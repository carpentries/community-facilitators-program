Work on this module will begin in Q3 2021. 

The **Communications facilitation** module of the Community Facilitators Program hopes to prepare community members to, among other things, 

    - join a community-led committee to help translate key communications so we can share these in languages other than English across our socials
    - Scout for good candidates across our community to speak in panel-style, monthly Carpentries conversations 

> If you are interested in collaborating with us to co-create a specific community facilitation module that may also be of interest for your community, please [reach out to the Community Development Team via email](mailto:community@carpentries.org?subject=Interest%20in%20co-creating%20Community%20Facilitators%20Program%20resources).
