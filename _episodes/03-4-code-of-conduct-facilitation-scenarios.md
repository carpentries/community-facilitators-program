## First Set of Examples

Below are scenarios that can cause discomfort or Code of Conduct (CoC) violation at a workshop and recommended approaches on how to try and address them. These are summarised from a discussion with community members at UKZN Durban, South Africa. This discussion was conducted on the topic of designating CoC facilitators at The Carpentries spaces to address CoC related incidents. Participants in small groups discussed the challenging scenarios that they had to deal with in past events or any possible scenario that may occur in the future. These scenarios can be commonly faced by our community members, and the recommendations will help the organisers, CoC facilitators, and Participants to address them. 

### Scenario 1:

A participant faced an uncomfortable situation during the event/workshop. Who can they contact to report bias incidents? 

>**Solution**
>
> - Organisers: The organiser will designate a trained Code of Conduct facilitator to help in reporting of these incidents and what resources they will have to support them 
> - CoC facilitators: The CoC facilitators will already have guidance on how to take reports or respond in case of potential CoC violations from their onboarding and training. They should agree with the organisers about the mechanisms to ask questions, get clarifications regarding CoC, addressing incidents, timeframe, etc particularly in situations where institutions have a separate CoC process from that of The Carpentries.
> - Participants: Participants should take note of the precise contact information of the person(s) who can be contacted in case of an emergency that they or their colleagues may face at the event. These contacts should be listed on the website, shared by email and mentioned at the beginning of each day at the workshop for the event participants.
