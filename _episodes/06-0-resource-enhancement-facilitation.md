Work on this module will begin in Q3 2021. 

The **Resource-enhancement facilitation** module of the Community Facilitators Program hopes to prepare community members for content design facilitation that will inform the publication and archival of community-created resources in a way that makes them accessible to all, and lowers barriers to knowledge acquisition by other community members i.e. replacing sea of text with images, GIFs, videos, illustrating workflows to make them easier to understand, managing tags and their use to collate resources across Carpentries platforms, etc

> If you are interested in collaborating with us to co-create a specific community facilitation module that may also be of interest for your community, please [reach out to the Community Development Team via email](mailto:community@carpentries.org?subject=Interest%20in%20co-creating%20Community%20Facilitators%20Program%20resources).
