Discussions around the scope and premise of this module will begin in November 2020 and work to write this module will begin in Q1 2021. 

The **Code of Conduct facilitation** module of the Community Facilitators Program hopes to prepare community members to bridge between community members at events and our Code of Conduct processes, and will be developed by The Carpentries Community Development Team, Lou Woodley's team at [CSCCE](https://cscce.org) and The Carpentries Code of Conduct committee.
    
> If you are interested in collaborating with us to co-create a specific community facilitation module that may also be of interest for your community, please [reach out to the Community Development Team via email](mailto:community@carpentries.org?subject=Interest%20in%20co-creating%20Community%20Facilitators%20Program%20resources).
