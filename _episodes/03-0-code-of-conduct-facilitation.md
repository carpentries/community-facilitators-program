Discussions around the scope and premise of this module began in November 2020 and work to write this module started in Q1 2021. The module will be published in May 2021.

The **Code of Conduct facilitation** module of the Community Facilitators Program hopes to prepare community members to bridge between community members at events and our Code of Conduct processes, and is currently under development by Serah Rono, The Carpentries Community Development Team Lead. The Carpentries Code of Conduct committee will oversee the onboarding, mentoring and support process of Code of Conduct facilitators in The Carpentries.
