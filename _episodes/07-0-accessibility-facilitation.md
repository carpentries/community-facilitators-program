Work on this module will begin in Q3 2021. 

The **Accessibility facilitation** module of the Community Facilitators Program hopes to prepare community members to review Carpentries accessibility guidelines that guide interactions in online and in-person spaces, as well as the creation of written and audio-visual content and choice of platforms. Ideally, these guidelines will be authored by Core Team and passed along to community facilitators for expansion, enforcement and maintenance i.e. update guidelines as nature of interactions or platforms evolve.
