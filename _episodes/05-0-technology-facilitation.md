Work on this module will begin in Q3 2021. 

The **Technology facilitation** module of the Community Facilitators Program hopes to prepare community members to run a community-facing and community-led helpdesk for all everyday ‘how-do-I’ questions that newcomers have as they collaborate with others on platforms that the community uses i.e. GitHub

> If you are interested in collaborating with us to co-create a specific community facilitation module that may also be of interest for your community, please [reach out to the Community Development Team via email](mailto:community@carpentries.org?subject=Interest%20in%20co-creating%20Community%20Facilitators%20Program%20resources).
